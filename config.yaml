      I love solving problems, especially if they can be solved with a program I made. I also love video games, especially if they take me to a fantasy world inside my head.
      After working for about five years in automation programming, I started looking for new challenges.
      I noticed that I would like to focus more and more deeply on programming and I would like to program graphically nicer and more
      entertaining environments than is possible in the automation industry. 
      So I went to study information technology. 
      After a few programming courses and an algorithm course, games started to interest me with programming in mind. 
      I think game programming is the most interesting thing to program. After the first game programming course I was hooked, this is what I want to do as a profession one day.
      Now I have studied the use of Unity and Unreal Engine and participated in Centria's game workshop. 
      I will continue to accumulate my knowledge and skills about game industry until one day I work with games.
