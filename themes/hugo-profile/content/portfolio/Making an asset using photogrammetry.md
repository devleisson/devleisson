## Making an 3D asset using photogrammetry

I tested making an asset for the Unreal Engine game engine using photogrammetry. I photographed the natural tree canopy with my smartphone. I took about 270 photos which I took to the darktable application for preprocessing. After that, I took the photos to the Meshroom application, which, after workflow, created a mesh for me. I exported the finished mesh to Blender in .obj format to check everything is ok and after that exported that in .fbx format for Unreal Engine.
